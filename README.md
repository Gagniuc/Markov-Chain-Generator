# Markov Chains Generator
A Markov Chains Generator (MCG) is a prediction machine that uses a transition matrix to generate sequences that are similar to the training sequence. Thus, the output of a MCG mimics the training sequence that led to the values from the transition matrix and the process itself represents a prediction.
